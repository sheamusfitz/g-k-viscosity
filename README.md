# branches

## fft

this branch has the analysis of the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. the jupyter notebook is very complicated to merge between versions, unfortunately.


## combine-multilength-viscosity

On second thought, there's no need to merge this with 
`g-k-viscosity.py`: this is not part of the analysis i'll often need (or 
probably need ever again), in which I "manually" create a lower resolution
output trajectory and analyze that instead.
